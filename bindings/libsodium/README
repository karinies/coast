Version 0.1 2013-04-27

A Racket Scheme binding for libsodium-0.4.1 (available at http://download.dnscrypt.org/libsodium/releases/).
libsodium is a machine-independent version of NaCL (Networking and Cryptography Library - http://nacl.cr.yp.to/).

To construct libsodium-0.4.1 simply unpack the *.tar.gz file and incant:

./configure
make
make check
make install

to build the library and install it as /usr/local/lib/libsodium.*

The Racket bindings expect to find libsodium.* in /usr/local/lib and if you
install it elsewhere change line 11 of sodium.rkt:

        (define sodium (ffi-lib "/usr/local/lib/libsodium" '("4" #f)))

to reflect your choice.

To use the bindings just include the path ".../bindings/libsodium/crypto.rkt" in the (require ...) declaration
of your module.
